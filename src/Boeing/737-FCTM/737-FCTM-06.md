## Flare and Touchdown

### Bounced Landing Recovery

If higher than idle thrust is maintained through initial touchdown, the automatic speedbrake deployment may be disabled even when the speedbrakes are armed. This can result in a bounced landing. During the resultant bounce, if the thrust levers are then retarded to idle, automatic speedbrake deployment can occur. This results in a loss of lift and nose up pitching moment which can result in a tail strike or hard landing on a subsequent touchdown.

If the airplane bounces during a landing attempt, hold or re-establish a normal landing attitude and add thrust as necessary to control the rate of descent. Thrust need not be added for a shallow bounce or skip. If a high, hard bounce occurs, initiate a go-around. Manually advance thrust levers to go-around thrust, and verify speedbrakes are retracted. Do not retract the flaps or landing gear until a positive rate of climb is established because a second touchdown may occur during the go-around. When safely airborne continue with the Go-Around and Missed Approach procedure as prescribed in the FCOM/QRH.

Note: When landing, the TO/GA switches of fail operational airplanes are inhibited near touchdown and on the ground. Refer to the FCOM, Automatic Flight chapter for details.
