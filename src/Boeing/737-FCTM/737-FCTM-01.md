## Key Elements of Flight Deck Design

- All displays and controls required for flight are designed to be viewable and reachable by both pilots or duplicated at each crew station and perform satisfactorily under all lighting conditions.

- Quiet or dark flight deck during normal operations. There are minimal indications of normal status.

- Alerts are categorized into time-critical warnings, warnings and cautions, and are prioritized by the urgency of required pilot response.
  - Time critical warnings are non-normal operational or system condition requiring immediate crew awareness and corrective action to maintain safe flight.
  - Warnings alert the crew to a non-normal operational or system condition requiring immediate crew awareness and corrective action
  - Cautions alert the crew to a non-normal operational or system condition that require the possible need for future corrective action.

### Pilot Responsibilities

Boeing flight decks are designed to support the priorities of aviate, navigate, communicate, and manage airplane systems.

The flight deck design assumes the pilot will:

- Respond correctly and safely to alert conditions.
- Prioritize warnings over cautions.
- Maintain situational awareness at all times. Both pilots should check the flight instruments and flight mode annunciations and verify that the airplane is responding appropriately. Both pilots need to anticipate what needs to be done next and how the airplane should respond.
- Use the appropriate level of automation for the situation. Hand off a task to automation in the state needed. Engage automation when the workload increases and take over manual control of the airplane when needed.
- Apply critical thinking and judgment. If indications are not as expected seek verifying information and take appropriate action.

## Operational Philosophy

### Events Requiring Maintenance Inspection

During ground or flight operations, events may occur which require a maintenance inspection after the flight. Use the following guidance to determine which events require a maintenance inspection:

- hard landing

  - specify if the landing was hard on the nose gear only, hard on the main gear only or hard on both main and nose gear. Specify if the landing was a hard bounced landing
  - Note: A bounced landing is defined as a landing where both main gears contact the ground and then both main gears leave the ground prior to landing.
  - Note: A nose first landing is considered to be a hard nose gear landing.

- overweight landing

  - if the overweight landing was not a hard landing the flight crew should record that the landing was not a hard landing

- high drag/high side load event

  - one or more of the following conditions occurred:
    - airplane ran off the prepared surface
    - airplane landed short of prepared surface
    - two or more tires were blown during landing
    - one or more landing gear hit an obstacle or were hit by an obstacle
    - airplane landed with a large crab or high bank angle resulting in abnormally large side-to-side forces as the airplane aligns with the runway after touchdown.

- severe turbulence
- overspeed - flap/slat, MMO/VMO, landing gear, landing gear tires
- high-energy stop (refer to the AMM for guidance)
- lightning strike
- extreme dust
- tail strike
- any event that the pilot feels a maintenance inspection could be needed. An example of such an event is an overly aggressive pitch up during a TCAS event or a Terrain Avoidance maneuver that could cause structural damage.
- operator-specific procedures or policies may include additional events that require a maintenance inspection.
- Note: If in doubt, the best course of action is to report it.
