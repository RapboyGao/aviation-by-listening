## Key Elements of Flight Deck Design

- All displays and controls required for flight are designed to be viewable and reachable by both pilots or duplicated at each crew station and perform satisfactorily under all lighting conditions.

- Quiet or dark flight deck during normal operations. There are minimal indications of normal status.

- Alerts are categorized into time-critical warnings, warnings and cautions, and are prioritized by the urgency of required pilot response.
  - Time critical warnings are non-normal operational or system condition requiring immediate crew awareness and corrective action to maintain safe flight.
  - Warnings alert the crew to a non-normal operational or system condition requiring immediate crew awareness and corrective action
  - Cautions alert the crew to a non-normal operational or system condition that require the possible need for future corrective action.
