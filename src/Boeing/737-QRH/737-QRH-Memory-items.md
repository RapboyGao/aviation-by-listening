## Emergency Descent

- Condition: One or more of these occur:

  - Cabin altitude cannot be controlled
  - A rapid descent is needed.

- Announce the emergency descent. The pilot flying will advise the cabin crew, on the PA system, of impending rapid descent. The pilot monitoring will advise ATC and obtain the area altimeter setting.

Passenger signs - On

- **Without delay**, descend to the lowest safe altitude or 10,000 feet, whichever is higher.

- ENGINE START switches (both) - CONT

- Thrust levers (both) Reduce - thrust to minimum or as needed for anti-ice

- SPEED BRAKE - FLIGHT DETENT

- If structural integrity is in doubt, limit speed as much as possible and avoid high maneuvering loads.

  - Set target speed to Mmo/Vmo.

## CABIN ALTITUDE WARNING or Rapid Depressurization

- Condition: One or more of these occur:
- A cabin altitude exceedance
- In flight, the intermittent cabin altitude/configuration warning horn sounds or a CABIN ALTITUDE light illuminates.

- Don oxygen masks and set regulators to 100%.
- Establish crew communications.
- Pressurization mode selector - MAN
- Outflow VALVE switch - Hold in CLOSE until the outflow VALVE indication shows fully closed
- If cabin altitude is uncontrollable:
  Passenger signs - ON
  PASS OXYGEN switch - ON
- Go to the Emergency Descent checklist on page 0.1

## Approach to Stall or Stall Recovery

### Initiate the recovery

- Hold the control column firmly.
- Disengage autopilot and autothrottle.
- Smoothly apply nose down elevator to reduce the angle of attack until buffet or stick shaker stops. Nose down stabilizer trim can be needed. \*

### Continue the recovery

- Roll in the shortest direction to wings level if needed.\*\*
- Advance thrust levers as needed.
- Retract the speedbrakes.
- Do not change gear or flap configuration, except
  - During liftoff, if flaps are up, call for flaps 1.

### Complete the recovery

- Check airspeed and adjust thrust as
  needed.
- Establish pitch attitude.
- Return to the desired flight path.
- Re-engage the autopilot and autothrottle if desired.

## GPWS Warning

- Disengage autopilot.
- Disengage autothrottle.
- Aggressively apply maximum\* thrust.
- Simultaneously roll wings level and rotate to an initial pitch attitude of 20°.
- Retract speedbrakes.
- If terrain remains a threat, continue rotation up to the pitch limit indicator (if available) or stick shaker or initial buffet.
- Do not change gear or flap configuration until terrain separation is assured. Monitor radio altimeter for sustained or increasing terrain separation.
- When clear of terrain, slowly decrease pitch attitude and accelerate.

Note: Aft control column force increases as the airspeed decreases. In all cases, the pitch attitude that results in intermittent stick shaker or initial buffet is the upper pitch attitude limit. Flight at intermittent stick shaker may be needed to obtain a positive terrain separation. Use smooth, steady controls to avoid a pitch attitude overshoot and stall.

Note: Do not use flight director commands.

Note: \*Maximum thrust can be obtained by advancing the thrust levers full forward if the EECs are in the normal mode. If terrain contact is imminent, advance thrust levers full forward.

## Rejected Takeoff

Before 80 knots, reject the takeoff for any of the following:

- activation of the master caution system
- system failure(s)
- unusual noise or vibration
- tire failure
- abnormally slow acceleration
- takeoff configuration warning
- fire or fire warning
- engine failure
- predictive windshear warning
- if a side window opens
- if the airplane is unsafe or unable to fly.

Above 80 knots and before V1, reject the takeoff for any of the following:

- fire or fire warning
- engine failure
- predictive windshear warning
- if the airplane is unsafe or unable to fly.

### Captain

Without delay:
Simultaneously close the thrust levers, disengage the autothrottles and apply maximum manual wheel brakes or verify operation of RTO autobrake.
If RTO autobrake is selected, monitor system performance and apply manual wheel brakes if the AUTO BRAKE DISARM light illuminates or deceleration is not adequate.
Raise SPEED BRAKE lever.
Apply reverse thrust up to the maximum amount consistent with conditions.
Continue maximum braking until certain the airplane can stop on the runway.

When stopping is assured:
Start movement of the reverse thrust levers to reach the reverse idle detent before taxi speed.
After the engines are at reverse idle, move the reverse thrust levers to full down.

When the airplane is stopped, perform procedures as needed.
Review Brake Cooling Schedule for brake cooling time and precautions (refer to Performance Inflight Chapter.)

Consider the following:

- The possibility of wheel fuse plugs melting
- The need to clear the runway
- The requirement for remote parking
- Wind direction in case of fire
- Alerting fire equipment
- Not setting the parking brake unless passenger evacuation is necessary
- Advising the ground crew of the hot brake hazard
- Advising passengers of the need to remain seated or evacuate
- Completion of Non-Normal checklist (if appropriate) for conditions which caused the RTO.

## Upset Recovery

Historically, an upset was defined as unintentionally exceeding one or more of the following conditions:

- Pitch attitude greater than 25 degrees nose up
- Pitch attitude greater than 10 degrees nose down
- Bank angle greater than 45 degrees
- Less than the above parameters but flying at an airspeed inappropriate for the conditions.

### Nose High Recovery - Pilot Flying

Recognize and confirm the developing situation

Disengage autopilot.
Disengage autothrottle.

Recover:

- Apply nose-down elevator. Apply as much elevator as needed to obtain a nose down pitch rate
- Apply appropriate nose down stabilizer trim\*
- Reduce thrust
- Roll (adjust bank angle) to obtain a nose down pitch rate.\*

Complete the recovery:

- When approaching the horizon, roll to wings level
- Check airspeed and adjust thrust
- Establish pitch attitude.

### Nose Low Recovery - Pilot Flying

Recognize and confirm the developing situation

Disengage autopilot.
Disengage autothrottle.

Recover:

- Recover from stall, if needed
- Roll in the shortest direction to wings level. If bank angle is more than 90 degrees, unload and roll. \*

Complete the Recovery:

- Apply nose up elevator
- Apply nose up trim, if needed \*
- Adjust thrust and drag, if needed.

WARNING: \* Excessive use of pitch trim or rudder can aggravate an upset, result in loss of control, or result in high structural loads.

## Windshear

Note: The following are indications the airplane is in windshear:

- windshear warning (two–tone siren followed by “WINDSHEAR, WINDSHEAR, WINDSHEAR”) or
- unacceptable flight path deviations.

Note: Unacceptable flight path deviations are recognized as uncontrolled changes from normal steady state flight conditions below 1000 feet AGL, in excess of any of the following:

- 15 knots indicated airspeed
- 500 fpm vertical speed
- 5° pitch attitude
- 1 dot displacement from the glideslope
- unusual thrust lever position for a significant period of time.

## Windshear Escape Maneuver - Pilot Flying

### MANUAL FLIGHT

- Disengage autopilot.
- Push either TO/GA switch.
- Aggressively apply maximum thrust\*
- Disengage autothrottle.
- Simultaneously roll wings level and rotate toward an initial pitch attitude of 15 °.
- Retract speedbrakes.
- Follow flight director TO/GA guidance (if available)\*\*

### MANUAL OR AUTOMATIC FLIGHT

- Do not change flap or gear configuration until windshear is no longer a factor.
- Maintain wings level to maximize climb gradient, unless a turn is required for obstacle clearance
- Monitor vertical speed and altitude.
- Do not attempt to regain lost airspeed until windshear is no longer a factor.

Note: Aft control column force increases as the airspeed decreases. In all cases, the pitch attitude that results in intermittent stick shaker or initial buffet is the upper pitch attitude limit. Flight at intermittent stick shaker may be needed to obtain a positive terrain separation. Use smooth, steady controls to avoid a pitch attitude overshoot and stall.

Note: \*Maximum thrust can be obtained by advancing the thrust levers full forward if the EECs are in the normal mode. If terrain contact is imminent, advance thrust levers full forward.

Note: \*\*Do not exceed the Pitch Limit Indication.

Note: \*\*\* If TO/GA is not available, disengage autopilot and autothrottle and fly manually.

WARNING: \*\*\*\* Severe windshear can exceed the performance of the AFDS. Be prepared to disengage the autopilot and autothrottle and fly manually.
