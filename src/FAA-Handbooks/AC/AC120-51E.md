The human factors safety challenge and the CRM training response may be defined as follows:

### Human Factors

The multidisciplinary field of human factors is devoted to optimizing human performance and reducing human error. It incorporates the methods and principles of the behavioral and social sciences, engineering, and physiology. It is the applied science that studies people working together in concert with machines. It embraces variables that influence individual performance and variables that influence team or crew performance. It is recognized that inadequate system design or inadequate operator training can contribute to individual human error that leads to system performance degradation. Further, it is recognized that inadequate design and management of crew tasks can contribute to group errors that lead to system performance degradation.
